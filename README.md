# Rainfall-prediction-in-Australia
The dataset contains daily weather records from Australian weather stations. Features include temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, pressure, and cloud cover. Objective: predict rain tomorrow (RainTomorrow)

Features include temperature ranges (MinTemp, MaxTemp), rainfall (Rainfall), evaporation (Evaporation), sunshine duration (Sunshine), wind details (WindGustDir, WindGustSpeed, WindDir9am, WindDir3pm, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm), humidity (Humidity9am, Humidity3pm), atmospheric pressure (Pressure9am, Pressure3pm), cloud cover (Cloud9am, Cloud3pm), and temperature at specific times (Temp9am, Temp3pm). Additionally, there are binary variables like RainToday, indicating whether it rained on the previous day, and RainTomorrow, representing whether it will rain the next day.

The dataset's source is numerous weather stations across Australia, with observations available from the Bureau of Meteorology. Copyright belongs to the Commonwealth of Australia 2010, Bureau of Meteorology. The objective is to train a binary classification model to predict RainTomorrow based on the provided weather features.
